# BitcoinZ Explorer Charts Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Charts functionality in the BitcoinZ Explorer. The Charts feature allows users to view various blockchain statistics in graphical format.

## Added Features

1. **Charts Navigation Link**
   - Added "Charts" link to the main header navigation
   - The link directs users to the new Charts page

2. **Charts Page**
   - Created a new page with sidebar navigation for different chart types:
     - Block Size
     - Block Interval
     - Difficulty
     - Mining Revenue
     - Pool Stat
     - Mined Block
   - Implemented chart display area with date selector
   - Designed with the modern blue theme to match the rest of the explorer

## Implementation Details

### 1. Header Update

Modified `ModernHeader.js` to include the Charts navigation link. The header maintains its modern blue gradient style while adding the new functionality.

```jsx
<Link to="/charts" className="text-blue-100 hover:text-white px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium hover:bg-blue-800 transition-colors">
  Charts
</Link>
```

### 2. Charts Page Implementation

Created a new `Charts.js` page component that includes:

- Sidebar navigation for different chart types
- Main display area for the selected chart
- Date selector for timeframe selection
- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop

### 3. Routing

Added a new route in `App.js` to display the Charts page:

```jsx
<Route path="/charts" element={<Charts />} />
```

## How to Use

1. Click on the "Charts" link in the main navigation
2. Select a chart type from the sidebar (Block Size, Difficulty, etc.)
3. The corresponding chart will be displayed in the main area
4. Use the date selector to change the timeframe

## Technical Notes

- The Charts page uses state management to handle chart type selection
- The implementation maintains the modern, clean UI of the explorer
- All components are responsive and work on different screen sizes
- The header remains static to prevent rendering issues
