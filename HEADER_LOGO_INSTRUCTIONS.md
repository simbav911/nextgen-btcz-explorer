# BitcoinZ Header and Logo Implementation Guide

## Modern Header Implementation

The new modern header has been implemented with the following improvements:
- Clean, gradient background
- Improved typography
- Better spacing and alignment
- Proper logo placement
- Consistent styling

## Logo Implementation

### 1. Where to Place the Logo

The BitcoinZ logo should be placed in:
```
/public/logo.png
```

Copy your logo image (the circular blue logo with white "B" and blue "Z") to this location.

### 2. Logo Specifications

- The logo should be saved as a PNG file with transparency
- Recommended size: 120x120 pixels (will be displayed at 40x40 pixels)
- File name: `logo.png`

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

The header includes a fallback mechanism in case the logo cannot be loaded:
- It will try to load from `/public/logo.png` first
- If that fails, it will use the logo from the BitcoinZ website

### 4. Customizing the Logo Size

If you want to change the logo size, modify these files:

1. In `/src/components/ModernHeader.js`:
```jsx
<img 
  src="/logo.png" 
  alt="BitcoinZ" 
  className="h-10 w-10"  // Change h-10 w-10 to your desired size
  // ...
/>
```

2. In `/src/index.js` (static header):
```html
<img 
  src="/logo.png" 
  alt="BitcoinZ" 
  class="h-10 w-10"  // Change h-10 w-10 to your desired size
  // ...
/>
```

3. In `/src/components/ModernHeader.css`, update:
```css
.modern-logo {
  width: 40px;  /* Change this value */
  height: 40px; /* Change this value */
  object-fit: contain;
}
```

## Additional Notes

The header is implemented in two ways:
1. As a React component in `/src/components/ModernHeader.js`
2. As static HTML injected directly into the DOM in `/src/index.js`

This dual implementation ensures the header remains stable and doesn't cause rendering issues.
