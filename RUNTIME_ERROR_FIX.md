# BitcoinZ Explorer Chart Runtime Error Fix

## Error Fixed

**Error Message:**  
`"arc" is not a registered element`

This error occurred because the Chart.js components weren't properly registered, particularly the ArcElement which is required for Pie and Doughnut charts.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed PieChartDisplay.js:**
   - Properly imported the Chart.js components
   - Added explicit registration of ArcElement, Tooltip, and Legend

   ```javascript
   import {
     Chart as ChartJS,
     ArcElement,
     Tooltip,
     Legend
   } from 'chart.js';

   // Register required Chart.js components for pie charts
   ChartJS.register(
     ArcElement,
     Tooltip,
     Legend
   );
   ```

2. **Fixed LineChartDisplay.js:**
   - Properly imported all necessary Chart.js components
   - Added explicit registration of all required elements for line charts

   ```javascript
   import {
     Chart as ChartJS,
     CategoryScale,
     LinearScale,
     PointElement,
     LineElement,
     Title,
     Tooltip,
     Legend,
     Filler
   } from 'chart.js';

   // Register required Chart.js components for line charts
   ChartJS.register(
     CategoryScale,
     LinearScale,
     PointElement,
     LineElement,
     Title,
     Tooltip,
     Legend,
     Filler
   );
   ```

## Why This Fixed the Issue

The error occurred because Chart.js requires explicit registration of all the components you intend to use. The ArcElement is specifically required for pie charts, but wasn't properly registered in the application.

By adding the proper import statements and registration calls in each chart component, we ensure that all necessary Chart.js elements are available before the charts are rendered, preventing the runtime error.

## Additional Benefits

This approach also:
1. Makes each chart component self-contained and independent
2. Makes it clear which Chart.js elements each component depends on
3. Prevents potential conflicts if different components require different Chart.js elements
4. Follows Chart.js v3+ best practices for component registration
